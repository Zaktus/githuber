### About React + MobX State Tree & GraphQL

This project was initially built to test the latest features of the awesome [MobX State Tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) and [GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql).

This is Open Source so you should feel free to use it and modify it as you wanted. In fact, I encourage you to modify the structure or how I do things to fit your needs and the way you handle things, just set it to be comfortable to you.
